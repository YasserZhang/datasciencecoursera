How the script run_analysis.R works: 
  1, merge train data set and test data set, 
  2, subset all mean and sd columns from the merged data set, 
  3, add a activity name tag and subject tag back to each row, 
  4, and name each column with descriptive variable name, 
  5, and finally create a new data set out of it, grouped by activity name and subject, with the average of each original numeric variable.
