###R has ﬁve basic or “atomic” classes of objects:

###The most basic object is a vector

* character
* numeric (real numbers)
* integer
* complex
* logical (True/False)

A vector can only contain objects of the same class
BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of
different classes (indeed, that’s usually why we use them)
Empty vectors can be created with the vector() function.
